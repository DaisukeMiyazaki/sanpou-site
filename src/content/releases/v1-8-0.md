## Smarter Map Pins

Nearby memos now automatically group into blue cluster markers with counts. Zoom in to see individual pins, or zoom out to get the big picture at a glance.

## See Memo Details Right on the Map

Tap any red pin to pull up a detail card at the bottom. Drag it up if you want to read more.

## Filter Memos by Time

New time slider at the top of the map. Slide the handles to show only the memos from a specific period.

## Help Pages & Tips

Hit the "?" icon on the memo list or map to see a quick guide of what everything does.
First-time tips pop up to help you get started. Dismiss them once and they won't bother you again.

## Send Us Feedback

This app is built by a small solo team, but your voice matters a lot. There's now a feedback form built right into the app — find it in the help pages or settings. Bug reports, feature ideas, questions — anything is welcome!
