title: "Why Your Best Ideas Happen Away from the Desk"

It started with a problem everyone knows: I wasn't moving enough.

Remote work made life flexible, but it also made it easy to go entire days without stepping outside. So I made a simple change — I started walking. Just walking.

After about a year of this habit, I noticed something I hadn't expected.

## Ideas Don't Wait for You to Sit Down

As an engineer, I'd always had this vague feeling that my thinking got clearer when I stepped away from the screen. Debugging a tricky problem? Go for a walk. Stuck on architecture? Leave the desk.

But walking regularly made this pattern impossible to ignore. The best ideas — the ones that connect dots you didn't know existed — kept showing up mid-stride, not mid-typing.

This led me to a hypothesis:

**"The seeds of new ideas and the organization of existing thoughts happen not while sitting at the desk, but in the moments away from it."**

Is this just a personal quirk? Or does everyone eventually notice the same thing?

## The Catch: Ideas Have a Very Short Shelf Life

Here's where the problem gets real.

Walking is great for generating ideas. But an idea you can't capture is an idea you lose. And the window is painfully short — a few seconds of clarity before the thought dissolves.

Paper notebooks work, but pulling out a pen while walking is clumsy. And using a full-featured note app is somehow worse: by the time you open it, pick a folder, and wait for the editor to load, the original spark is already fading.

What's needed is not another note app. It's a tool designed for one specific moment: **the instant an idea appears in your head.**

## Capture First, Organize Later

This is the idea behind Sanpou.

- Launch the app — you're immediately on the input screen. No folders, no formatting.
- Tap and speak. Speech-to-text converts your voice to text instantly.
- Later, export the memo as Markdown and send it to whatever note app you actually use for organizing — Obsidian, Notion, Apple Notes, whatever works for you.

Sanpou is not a replacement for your note-taking system. It's the front door. The "wrapper" that sits between the moment a thought is born and the moment you get back to your desk.

## Why This Matters More in the Age of AI

Generative AI can produce polished text in seconds. But it can't produce *your* original observations — the things that come from *your* experiences, *your* walks, *your* specific way of seeing the world.

In a world where AI-generated content is everywhere, the value of genuine first-person insights has only gone up. The bottleneck is no longer "writing it up nicely." It's **capturing the raw thought before it disappears.**

That's what Sanpou is for.

## The Question Remains Open

I call this line of thinking "The Sanpou Issue" — an ongoing investigation into where ideas come from and how to catch them.

I don't have a final answer yet. But every walk brings me closer.
