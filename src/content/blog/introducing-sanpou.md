Walking is one of the simplest things we do every day, yet some of the best ideas come to us mid-stride. Sanpou was built to capture those fleeting thoughts without breaking your pace.

## What is Sanpou?

Sanpou is an iOS app that combines voice memos, step tracking, and map visualization into a single, lightweight experience. The idea is simple: when a thought hits you on a walk, just tap and talk. Your voice gets transcribed into a memo, tagged with your location and step count automatically.

## Key Features

**Voice-first memos** — Tap the record button, speak your mind, and you're done. Speech-to-text handles the rest.

**Map view** — All your memos are pinned on a map. You can filter by time, tap pins for details, and see where your best thinking happens.

**Step tracking** — HealthKit integration means your daily steps are captured alongside every memo. No extra setup needed.

**Markdown export** — Every memo can be exported as a Markdown file. If you use Obsidian or another note-taking app, your walk notes can flow right into your knowledge base.

**Home / Away ratio** — Set a home spot and see how much of your memo-taking happens at home versus out in the world.

## Why "Sanpou"?

散歩 (sanpo) means "a walk" or "a stroll" in Japanese. We added a twist to make it our own.

## Get Started

Sanpou is available on the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/sanpou/id6749672561) for $4.99 (¥800). It's lightweight and respects your privacy — no accounts, no cloud sync, everything stays on your device.

We'd love to hear what you think. Use the built-in feedback form in the app, or reach out anytime.

Happy walking.
